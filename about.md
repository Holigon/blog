My name is Noah. I'm 20 years old, and I'm from Denmark!
I'm pursuing an education in **Computer Science** at the Aarhus University in Denmark. After this, I hope to also pursue an education in **Philosophy**.  
I've always been passionate about computers - been in front of one since I was 3 years old - and I have a great deal of respect for math. I'd like to eventually work in the research field, as I believe there is a lot of uncharted territory left when it comes to Computer Science.  
I also believe that a lot of these advancements on the horizon need to be understood from an ethical perspective, as to establish moral guidelines.

I'm currently in the process of learning Python, and hope to join some open source projects in the future to develop my skills in both the language, but also the field of programming.  
While my understanding of actual code development is limited, I do consider myself to be knowledgeable on the current developments of the field, as I like to keep up.
