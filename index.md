## **Welcome**

My name is Noah Matzen (20), and I'm from Denmark.

This website will be used to publish project reports that I will write, to have my programming process written down somewhere.  
These reports will be for a variety of different programs, all intended to facilitate my learning.  

Python 3 will be the language these programs are written in (for now).
