## **Report Structure Guidelines**

I want to structure my project reports in a rigid manner to effectivise the writing process, and to be able to have an easy way to look back on the thougt process behind each project.

*Guidelines*:

1. **Introduction** - What is the purpose of the program? What does the program do?
2. **Goals** - What are my goals for this project? (Learning, Functionality, Uses, etc.)
3. **Process** - How did I approach the goals? How did I come up with the idea?
4. **Execution** - How does the code work? What paths does it follow? (Maybe diagrams as visual aid?)
5. **Methods** - Which built-in functions did I use? Did I import libaries? Which?
6. **Hindsight** - Did I do something that in hindsight could've been done better? Any regrets? Any critisism?
7. **Conclusion** - Did I achieve my goals? How could I improve? Anything I need to remember for the next project?
